        here are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
        majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
        randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
        going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
        anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
        necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses
        a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
        sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
        generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
        humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

        SMILEY: Hi, Lia. What seems to be the problem today?
        <br />
        LIA: I hope you can tell me! A chunk of my tooth broke off yesterday.
        <br />
        SMILEY: That‚Äôs not good. Did you bite something hard?
        <br />
        LIA: No, I didn‚Äôt . . . that‚Äôs the weird thing. It just kind of fell
        out.
        <br />
        SMILEY: Did it hurt when it broke?
        <br />
        LIA: Yes, it did, just a little; but it started to hurt like crazy this
        morning.
        <br />
        SMILEY: I think we‚Äôd better take a full set of X-rays . . . Okay, open
        wide. Let me take a look. Oh, boy. Yes, it looks like you‚Äôve exposed the
        root on your left, molar.
        <br />
        LIA: rgscht rfghsh!! ghs gtfhhkj?
        <br />
        SMILEY: Sorry. I‚Äôll be done in a minute. I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll have to have
        a root canal. I can put in a temporary filling, but you‚Äôll have to come
        back in two weeks for the procedure.
        <br />
        LIA: Do I have to have a root canal? My tooth doesn‚Äôt really hurt too
        much.
        <br />
        SMILEY: If we don‚Äôt take care of this quickly, it may become infected,
        and it will hurt a lot. I‚Äôll tell Dina to set up an appointment, and
        I‚Äôll see you back here in two weeks, on Tuesday, the 14th, at 3 p.m.
        <br />
        LIA: Will the procedure hurt?
        <br />
        SMILEY: I‚Äôll give you medication so that you won‚Äôt feel any pain. Relax!
        It‚Äôs not so bad!
